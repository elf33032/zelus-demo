## What are the different use cases of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH http requests?
### GET
**GET** is used to perform read or retrieve actions. Usually we use GET for requesting source or data passing either from DB to backend or from backend to frontend. Ususally, we uses JSON format to contain our data. Since GET method does not send any data, it should not have a message body.
### POST
**POST** is used to send data from client to the server. POST is typically use to create new documents or resources in the server. POST request is typically sent by an HTML form element, and the content of the form results in updating the server. A successfuly POST will have a response code of 200. The body of POST should be the data sending to the server. POST is not idempotent, which means consecutive identical POST cause the server to change state and, therefore, having side effects.
### PUT
**PUT** request is to create a new resource or replace(update) a representation of the target resource. PUT is different from POST because that the idea of PUT is to be idempotent, which means consecutively identical calls does not change the server several times. The importance of idempotent idea is that to prevent, for example, putting the same order or making finicial transaction many times in case the user may spam the submit button. PUT will have a response code of 200 as well.

### PATCH
**PATCH** is similar to PUT, instead PATCH updates partial resources. For example, when we would like only update the first name attribute of an record, we can use PATCH to achieve this with preserving all other data in the record. 

## What are the differences between MongoDB, Postgres, and Firebase? What are the use cases of them?
### MongoDB
**MongoDB** is a very populat document NOSQL database. It allows JSON-like docuemnt storage. This means that the schema of every document are not necessarily to be clearly defined beforehand. Since MongoDB stores in document structure, it has good scalability that supporting data storage in serveral DB nodes. In every documents, every data entry is store with a key-value pairs like it in JSON. MongoDB supports literal, array and nested object storage. MongoDB hash every document to have a unique ID so that every document are unique and determinant. MongoDB can handle most of data types and the usage is very large.
### PostgreSQL
**PostgreSQL** is a relational database which is free and powerful. Postgres are classic SQL database supporting standard SQL syntax and SQL function. PostgreSQL adds few data types, functions, operators, aggregate functions based on standard SQL. SQL are stored in tables, and every table will have a fixed schema. Tables contains pointer to data pages while pages contains pointers to data records (rows). Data stored on the persist storage will be typically either sorted structure or using a B+ tree. Users uses SQL syntax to perform CRUD operation and Queries based on relational algebra. The relational algebra are implemented usually using Join operations and Aggregate Operations. SQL are good for datasets which need to perform JOIN a lot (for example, retriving linked information from different tables/collections). It optimizes the speed for joining because of the join tree optimization ability.
### Firebase
**Firebase** is a online NoSQL database. It has two parts, realtime database and Cloud Firestore. Real-Time Database is a pubsub system for rapid updating and retrieving data, whereas Firestore retrieve data based on references. Firebase are better for small applications compared to MongoDB.
## ExpressJS GET
``` javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/my-properties', (req, res) => {
    res.json({mockPropertyAddress:{
    line1:'123 Main Street', 
    line2:'Apt 22', 
    city:'New York', 
    state:'New York', 
    zipcode: 12345}
    });
  }
)
```
## ExpressJS POST
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/post-test', (req, res) => {
    console.log('Got body:', req.body);
    res.sendStatus(201);
});
```
## Why Controller?
Basically every controller includes a set of http request callbacks when requests are called from each path and url. They corresponds to the action that our api should do after receiving http requests.
## Why Model?
Models define the schema of data retrieved from DB. So with model, we can define which attribute from the document that we want to use and retrieve.
## Why Routes?
Routers bind controllers with path for sub-apps. It defines which controller to use under which path and http requests.

## What is Headless CMS?
Headless CMS, just like normal CMS, is a technique to publish "high-level" categorized information to the web app acting as a media between web-app and database by interpreting "low-level" data read from database.  
Traditional CMS link the system with one type of front-end representation, where the layout (? not very sure) are fixed.  
Headless CMS only contains the contents that the app wants to show in any platform. It decouples the content and the UI so that on every platform or every framework, the app can simply plug in the content as developer's wish.

## Why Headless?
Headless CMS has a major benefit is that it does not rely on the UI or the platform. So for an app with different presentations, for example, either web-app, phone app, or app on other devices can access and present the same set of contents using any source code framework or structure. Headless CMS no more makes assertion on the language that the app uses
