# Milestone 3

### How many tables do we need and what for?

We are going to need 2 tables. One table is for user personal informations.  
In our case, first name and last name.
The other will be for properties.
In our case, property name and address details. 
We are going to make surrogate primary keys for every user and properties to make sure the uniqueness.
We are also going to make a foreign key from person table to properties in order to link every person with the property information. 

### What type are they?
All keys except surrogate keys should be VARCHAR. Surrogated keys can be generated by different algorithms, therefore can be integers or VARCHAR depended on which rule we use.  

### What are validation rules?
All keys except Apt numbers should be tagged NOT NULL.
Surrogated primary keys in its table should be UNIQUE, foreign key in the property table (user id) are not UNIQUE. 

### Strapi Key steps
1. Strapi models can be created from either GUI or CLI. 
2. Strapi models are used to contain data just like SQL tables, but with more structures and types.
3. Strapi models are required to have Display name, API singular and plural names.
4. Strapi models can be collection type (contains multiple entries, like posts) or single type (only one entry, like notifications).
5. Strapi models can contain various types wrapped by strapi components. It can show plain texts, rich texts, enum, and many other types which are extra to standard SQL. 
6. Strapi has validation rules as following:  

Parameter	|Type	|Description	|Default
----------|-----|-------------|--------
required	| Boolean	| If true, adds a required validator for this property	| false
max	| Integer	| Checks if the value is greater than or equal to the given maximum	| -
min	| Integer	| Checks if the value is less than or equal to the given minimum	| -
minLength	| Integer	| Minimum number of characters for a field input value	| -
maxLength	| Integer	| Maximum number of characters for a field input value	| -
private	| Boolean	| If true, the attribute will be removed from the server response.ðŸ’¡ This is useful to hide sensitive data.	| false
configurable	| Boolean	| If false, the attribute isn't configurable from the Content-type Builder plugin. | true

## how to use Strapi in our app?
According to this [Strapi documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest-api.html#endpoints) Strapi supports HTTP request API calls.
When we send requests, Strapi send requests to our DB, and interpret the data into well-formatted, readable, and richly typed data back into our app.  
Strapi supports GET PUT POST DELETE on either collection or single entry CRUD operations.
